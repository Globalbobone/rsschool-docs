### Name
- Add Stage

### Summary
- New stage adds to the Schedule

### Rationale
- The student learning cycle has to go through some stages. The stages should be up-to-date. So the Admin should be able to add, delete or edit the stages.

### Users
- Admin

### Preconditions
- The User should have admin rights and stay on the Schedule page

### Basic Course of Events
1. The User notices that Schedule page has "Add Stage" button under the Schedule.
2. The User clicks that button. 
3. The "New Stage" form appears in the pop-up window.
4. The User fills the required "Title" field. 
5. The User chooses the start date of the stage in the required field "Start Date".
6. The User chooses the end date of the stage in the required field "End Date".
7. The User clicks the "Save" button to add stage to the Schedule. If the form was filled in the right way, see Step 8. In case of wrong filling of some fields, the system shows "valid" or "invalid" feedback under all fields.
8. The "New Stage" pop-up window hides from the page.

### Alternative Paths
- In steps 4-6, The User can decide not to add the new stage to the schedule. The User has some ways to close the pop-up window:
    - click on the "backdrop" of the pop-up window ;
    - click the iconic "X" button in the upper right corner;
    - click the "Cancel" button. 
- Then the "New Stage" pop-up window hides from the page. 

### Postconditions
In case of the successfully adding stage, the added stage is shown in the schedule in the special place according to the dates. Otherwise, the Schedule is unchanged.
